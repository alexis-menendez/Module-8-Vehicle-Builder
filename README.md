##  Vehicle Builder
**Description**

The README Generator is a command-line application that dynamically generates a high-quality, professional `README.md` file based on user input. By streamlining the README creation process, this tool enables developers to focus on building their projects rather than formatting documentation. 

**Features**

* Prompts users for project details such as title, description, installation, usage, license, and contributors.
* Dynamically generates a well-structured README file.
* Supports multiple license options with an automatically generated badge and relevant license section.
* Provides a table of contents with clickable links for easy navigation.

## Acknowledgements

* I used Github Copilot to help me write the code for this project, primarily its suggestive text feature which enabled me to write code faster.
* I also used ChatGPT to:
  	* Provide assitance debugging my code when I encountered some syntax errors that I was unable to locate on my own. The commits will reflect this, however, I am happy to provide transcripts of the conversation with ChatGPT upon request.
  	* Review my completed project and offer suggestions for improvement.
